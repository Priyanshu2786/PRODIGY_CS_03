This project focuses on developing a password complexity checker to enhance security measures in digital environments. The tool evaluates passwords against a set of predefined criteria, including length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters), and common vulnerabilities (like dictionary words). By providing instant feedback and recommendations, this checker helps users create stronger, more secure passwords, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and enhancing overall cybersecurity awareness.
